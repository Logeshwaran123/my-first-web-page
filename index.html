		<h3>Breif Introduction about IoT</h3>

		<!-- thematic ruler -->
		<hr />

		<p>
			The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such
			objects) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies
			that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the
			Internet or other communications networks. Internet of things has been
			considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the
			public internet, they only need to be connected to a network,[6] and be
			individually addressable.
		</p>

		<p>
			The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies,
			including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful
			embedded systems, as well as machine learning. Traditional fields of
			embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation
			(including home and building automation), independently and collectively
			enable the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is
			most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart
			home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures,
			thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances)
			that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via
			devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart
			speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.

		<h3>History about Internet of Things</h3>

		<hr />

		<p>
			The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as
			1982, with a modified Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon
			University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance, able to report
			its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not. Mark
			Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st
			Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced
			the contemporary vision of the IOT. In 1994, Reza Raji described the
			concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set
			of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances
			to entire factories". Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed
			solutions like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field gained
			momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as a part
			of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum at
			Davos in 1999.
